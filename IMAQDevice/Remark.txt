NAMING OF CS OBJECTS IN THE DETECTOR.INI MODE

The names for the CS instances is not completely free if you use the detectors.ini file.
Then you should use names like "Camera_TR5DF1". Here, Camera is necessary, TR5DF1 has to
be consistent with the names in the detectors.ini file (compare to [name][HITRAP TR5DF1]).

TIME-OUTS DURING STARTUP

If there are a lot of timeouts during the creation of the objects one can try to make
a small change in the registry. The reason for these time outs is most probably that
the "Enumerate Cameras.vi" in the constructor sends a multicast DNS around the network
to which also for instance all network printers answer (and this can take up to 1 min).
To overcome this problem one can switch of this DNS multicast resulting that IP cameras
should not work anymore (which means also MAX can not see them anymore). For whatever 
reason the GIGE cameras are still working (?). 
To change the settings open regedit, go to 

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\?services\niimaqdxk\Parameters
 
and set "EnableIPCameras" as a DWORD to 0.

Now you may still get timeouts, but in fact the object should be created (one can check
this by looking at the DIMservice NumberOfImages of the camera. If it is larger than 0
everything is ok.

Maybe it is enough to run for each PC one time the EnumerateCameras.vi and then to switch
of the IP camera broadcast, because the PC has already saved the important data.

DURING STARTUP YOU GET AN ERROR FROM THE VI ACQUIRE CONFIGURATION.VI

The reason is most probable that an old firmware / configuration file is used for the 
camera. The error also appears in MAX if you try to capture an image with the camera and
and it is gone when you restart CS / MAX and comes back when you restart the PC. If you
look closer to the error messages in the source code you will recognize that the acquire
configuration.vi shows that the parameters are out of range which in fact makes no sense.

TIMEOUT DURING IMAGE CAPTURE

Most probable the problem here is a wrong timeout value. So the timeout value of the camera
should be always larger than the complete acquisition time of the camera. Otherwise you will
never get a picture.
